TODO
====

* Provide alternative strategies instead of requiring ahead
  * Probe $LOAD_PATH + Gem-API (this is less reliable, though, since anything could
    hook into require - just like rubygems already does)
  * Lazy require - require upon querying availability, errors etc.
* Replace method_missing with generated methods
