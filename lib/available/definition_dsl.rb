    # The common way to specify a library is by a Symbol. If you do `requires :haml`, that
    # will try to `require 'haml'` and make the `available.has.haml?` method available.
    # Upon failure it will state "You must install the 'haml' library."
    #
    # You can also pass a hash, if the require and the name under which you want to query
    # your Available instance differ. If you do `requires template_engine: 'haml'`, it
    # will try to `require 'haml'` and make the `available.has.template_engine?` method
    # available. Upon failure it will state "You must install the 'haml' library."

    # associated Available instance will be false.
